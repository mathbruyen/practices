## Baseline

[Align baselines](http://coding.smashingmagazine.com/2012/12/17/css-baseline-the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly/) within adjacent columns: set `line-height` and `margin + padding` to a multiple of the smallest text size in the page for each and very element. [Tool](https://github.com/jkeyes/baseline) to visually check.
